 <h1>Interest in IT:Software development</h1>  
 <p>I did not study IT at high school, i learned about it when i first came to university.<br> What i knew was that IT people like hacking and stealing money from people, then i got to find out how broad IT is.</p>
 <p>I did my research and asked my programming Lecture what is this industry all about. <br>After her explanation i got interested in how one can create beautiful interactive websites using programming language then i knew i had to do programming.<br>Being able to communicate with a computer and tell it what to do by giving it commands is so cool even though sometimes when i run my programs and they don't run, i feel impatient but i realize that it teaches me patience both in my career and personal life that i must be patient and keep trying </p>
 <p>This industry is versatile and ever-changing it keeps you on your toes and knowing that, i chose to follow IT and i do not regret it because of the learning involved<br></p>
 <p>And that is the short version of my interest in IT.</p>
